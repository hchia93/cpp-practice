# cpp-topics

This repository is a curated collection of **C++ practice code, algorithmic problem solutions, and topic-driven explorations**.  
It serves as a structured workspace for consolidating small, self-contained experiments that focus on both **fundamentals** and **system-level concepts**.

## Structure
### Topic-Based Explorations
Organized by areas of study, including:
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, trees, graphs
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, dynamic programming, greedy methods
- **Concurrency**: Thread pools, synchronization patterns, parallel execution
- **Utilities & Patterns**: Custom helpers, allocators, or design practices
- **Test Questions & Experiments**: Problem-solving exercises and standalone snippets

## Notes
- Code here is **practice-oriented**, not production-ready.
- Each file is written to be **self-contained** for clarity and focus.
- The repository will continue to evolve as new topics, problem sets, and implementations are explored.

## Purpose
This project reflects an **ongoing learning journey** in modern C++, combining algorithmic problem-solving with explorations in **system programming** and **performance-critical patterns**.
