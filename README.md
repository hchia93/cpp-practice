# Readme

This repository is a personal collection of **C++ practice code, algorithm problems, and topic explorations**.
It serves as a workspace for experimenting with ideas, writing solutions to coding challenges, and consolidating small, self-contained code samples.

## Contents
### Topic-Based Collections
Focused explorations of specific areas, such as:
- Linked lists
- Trees and traversal techniques
- Thread pools and concurrency
- Other utilities or patterns of interest
- Test Questions & Experiments

## Notes
These files are practice-oriented, not production-ready libraries.
Code here is not tied to any specific application or user problem

The repository evolves as I explore new topics, problem sets, and implementations.
